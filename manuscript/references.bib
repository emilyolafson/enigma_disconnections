              separate motor areas related to motor output from areas
              essentially involved in higher-order motor control. Little is
              known about the function of these higher-order motor areas during
              simple voluntary movement. We examined a simple finger flexion
              movement in six healthy subjects using a novel brain-imaging
              approach, integrating high-resolution EEG with the individual
              structural and functional MRI. Electrical source reconstruction
              was performed in respect to the individual brain morphology from
              MRI. Highly converging results from EEG and fMRI were obtained
              for both executive and higher-order motor areas. All subjects
              showed activation of the primary motor area (MI) and of the
              frontal medial wall motor areas. Two different types of medial
              wall activation were observed with both methods: Four of the
              subjects showed an anterior type of activation, and two of the
              subjects a posterior type of activation. In the former, activity
              started in the anterior cingulate motor area (CMA) and
              subsequently shifted its focus to the intermediate supplementary
              motor area (SMA). Approximately 120 ms before the movement
              started, the intermediate SMA showed a drop of source strength,
              and simultaneously MI showed an increase of source strength. In
              the posterior type, activation was restricted to the posterior
              SMA. Further, three of the subjects investigated showed
              activation in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) starting during
              early movement preparation. In all subjects showing activation of
              higher-order motor areas (anterior CMA, intermediate SMA, IPL)
              these areas became active before the executive motor areas (MI
              and posterior SMA). We suggest that the early activation of the
              anterior CMA and the IPL may be related to attentional functions
              of these areas. Further, we argue that the intermediate part of
              the SMA triggers the actual motor act via the release of
              inhibition of the primary motor area. Our results demonstrate
              that a noninvasive, multimodal brain imaging technique can reveal
              individual cortical brain activity with high temporal and spatial
              resolution, independent of a priori physiological assumptions.",

              Diffusion-weighted images were used to create lesion masks, which
              were uploaded to the Network Modification (NeMo) Tool. The NeMo
              Tool, using only clinical MRIs, allows estimation of connectome
              disruption at three levels: whole brain, individual gray matter
              regions and between pairs of gray matter regions. Partial Least
              Squares Regression models were constructed for each level of
              connectome disruption and for each of the three six-month
              outcomes: applied cognitive, basic mobility and daily activity.
              Models based on lesion volume were created for comparison.
              Cross-validation, bootstrapping and multiple comparisons
              corrections were implemented to minimize over-fitting and Type I
              errors. The regional disconnection model best predicted applied
              cognitive (R(2) = 0.56) and basic mobility outcomes (R(2) =
              0.70), while the pairwise disconnection model best predicted the
              daily activity measure (R(2) = 0.72). These results demonstrate
              that models based on connectome disruption metrics were more
              accurate than ones based on lesion volume and that increasing
              anatomical specificity of disconnection metrics does not always
              increase model accuracy, likely due to statistical adjustments
              for concomitant increases in data dimensionality. This work
              establishes that the NeMo Tool's measures of baseline connectome
              disruption, acquired using only routinely collected MRI scans,
              can predict 6-month post-stroke outcomes in various functional
              domains including cognition, motor function and daily activities.

  abstract = "Behavioural deficits in stroke reflect both structural damage at
              the site of injury, and widespread network dysfunction caused by
              structural, functional, and metabolic disconnection. Two recent
              methods allow for the estimation of structural and functional
              disconnection from clinical structural imaging. This is achieved
              by embedding a patient's lesion into an atlas of functional and
              structural connections in healthy subjects, and deriving the
              ensemble of structural and functional connections that pass
              through the lesion, thus indirectly estimating its impact on the
              whole brain connectome. This indirect assessment of network
              dysfunction is more readily available than direct measures of
              functional and structural connectivity obtained with functional
              and diffusion MRI, respectively, and it is in theory applicable
              to a wide variety of disorders. To validate the clinical
              relevance of these methods, we quantified the prediction of
              behavioural deficits in a prospective cohort of 132 first-time
              stroke patients studied at 2 weeks post-injury (mean age 52.8
              years, range 22-77; 63 females; 64 right hemispheres).
              Specifically, we used multivariate ridge regression to relate
              deficits in multiple functional domains (left and right visual,
              left and right motor, language, spatial attention, spatial and
              verbal memory) with the pattern of lesion and indirect structural
              or functional disconnection. In a subgroup of patients, we also
              measured direct alterations of functional connectivity with
              resting-state functional MRI. Both lesion and indirect structural
              disconnection maps were predictive of behavioural impairment in
              all domains (0.16 < R2 < 0.58) except for verbal memory (0.05 <
              R2 < 0.06). Prediction from indirect functional disconnection was
              scarce or negligible (0.01 < R2 < 0.18) except for the right
              visual field deficits (R2 = 0.38), even though multivariate maps
              were anatomically plausible in all domains. Prediction from
              direct measures of functional MRI functional connectivity in a
              subset of patients was clearly superior to indirect functional
              disconnection. In conclusion, the indirect estimation of
              structural connectivity damage successfully predicted behavioural
              deficits post-stroke to a level comparable to lesion information.
              However, indirect estimation of functional disconnection did not
              predict behavioural deficits, nor was a substitute for direct
              functional connectivity measurements, especially for cognitive
              disorders.",

              FC disruptions reflect damage to specific cortical regions.
              However, an alternative explanation is that they reflect the
              structural disconnection (SDC) of white matter pathways. Here, we
              compare these explanations using data from 114 stroke patients.
              Across multiple analyses, we find that SDC measures outperform
              focal damage measures, including damage to putative critical
              cortical regions, for explaining FC disruptions associated with
              stroke. We also identify a core mode of structure-function

              widespread FC disruptions across patients and that correlates
              with deficits in multiple behavioral domains. We conclude that a

              its impact on FC and that interhemispheric SDCs may play a

              but unexplained variability in recovery still exists. In this
              study, we used lesion-mapping techniques in combination with
              diffusion tensor imaging to quantitatively test the hypothesis
              that motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke is inversely
              related to the proportion of the corticospinal tract (CST)
              affected by the lesion. METHODS: We studied 50 patients with
              chronic stroke, all of whom presented with moderate to severe
              motor impairments in the acute stage, using high-resolution
              anatomic MRI. We evaluated the degree of motor impairment with
              the Upper Extremity module of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment. To
              analyze the relationship between CST damage and impairment
              scores, we calculated a CST-lesion load for each patient by
              overlaying the patient's lesion map with a probabilistic tract
              derived from diffusion tensor images of age-matched healthy
              subjects. RESULTS: CST-lesion load was a significant predictor of
              motor deficit. Infarct size, despite correlating with motor
              scores, did not significantly predict impairment. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results show the degree of functional motor deficit after a
              stroke is highly dependent on the overlap of the lesion with the
              CST and not lesion size per se. In the future, automated
              calculation of CST-lesion load may allow more precise prediction

              has been shown to have a major effect on upper extremity motor

              injury, measured from neuroimaging acquired during the acute
              stroke workup, predicts upper extremity motor recovery. Methods-
              Patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were
              assessed using the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer during the acute
              stroke hospitalization and again at 3-month follow-up. CST injury
              was quantified and compared, using 4 different methods, from
              images obtained as part of the stroke standard-of-care workup.
              Logistic and linear regression were performed using CST injury to
              predict $\Delta$Fugl-Meyer. Injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices were included as potential modifiers of the effect of
              CST injury on recovery. Results- N=48 patients were enrolled
              4.2$\pm$2.7 days poststroke and completed 3-month follow-up
              (median 90-day modified Rankin Scale score, 3; interquartile
              range, 1.5). CST injury distinguished patients who reached their
              recovery potential (as predicted from initial impairment) from
              those who did not, with area under the curve values ranging from
              0.70 to 0.8. In addition, CST injury explained $\approx$20\% of
              the variance in the magnitude of upper extremity recovery, even
              after controlling for the severity of initial impairment. Results
              were consistent when comparing 4 different methods of measuring
              CST injury. Extent of injury to primary motor and premotor
              cortices did not significantly influence the predictive value
              that CST injury had for recovery. Conclusions- Structural injury
              to the CST, as estimated from standard-of-care imaging available
              during the acute stroke hospitalization, is a robust way to
              distinguish patients who achieve their predicted recovery
              potential and explains a significant amount of the variance in

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Motor impairment after stroke has been related to
              infarct size, infarct location, and integrity of motor tracts. To
              determine the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a
              predictor of motor outcome and its role as a structural surrogate
              marker of impairment in chronic stroke, we tested correlations
              between motor impairment and DTI-derived measures of motor tract
              integrity. METHODS: Thirty-five chronic stroke patients with
              varying degrees of recovery underwent DTI and motor impairment
              assessments. Fibers originating from the precentral gyrus were
              traced and separated into pyramidal tract (PT) and alternate
              motor fibers (aMF). Asymmetry indices of fiber number and
              regional fractional anisotropy (FA) values comparing lesional
              with nonlesional hemispheres were correlated with motor
              impairment scores and compared to an age-matched control group.
              RESULTS: Fiber number and regional FA value asymmetry
              significantly differed between the groups with lower values in
              the patients' lesional hemispheres. Both measures significantly
              predicted motor impairment with stronger predictions when all
              motor tracts were combined as compared to predictions using only
              the PT. The pattern of motor tract damage (PT only vs PT and aMF)
              led to a classification of mild, moderate, or severe impairment
              with significant between-group differences in motor impairment
              scores. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging-derived measures
              are valid structural markers of motor impairment. The integrity
              of all descending motor tracts, not merely the pyramidal tract,
              appears to account for stroke recovery. A 3-tier, hierarchical
              classification of impairment categories based on the pattern of
              motor tract damage is proposed that might be helpful in
              predicting recovery potential.",

              carries a crucial vulnerability: without stronger alternatives
              any consistent error cannot be easily detected. A hitherto
              unexamined source of such error is the structure of the
              high-dimensional distribution of patterns of focal damage,
              especially in ischaemic injury-the commonest aetiology in
              lesion-deficit studies-where the anatomy is naturally shaped by
              the architecture of the vascular tree. This distribution is so
              complex that analysis of lesion data sets of conventional size
              cannot illuminate its structure, leaving us in the dark about the
              presence or absence of such error. To examine this crucial
              question we assembled the largest known set of focal brain
              lesions (n = 581), derived from unselected patients with acute
              ischaemic injury (mean age = 62.3 years, standard deviation =
              17.8, male:female ratio = 0.547), visualized with
              diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and processed with
              validated automated lesion segmentation routines.
              High-dimensional analysis of this data revealed a hidden bias
              within the multivariate patterns of damage that will consistently
              distort lesion-deficit maps, displacing inferred critical regions
              from their true locations, in a manner opaque to replication.
              Quantifying the size of this mislocalization demonstrates that
              past lesion-deficit relationships estimated with conventional
              inferential methodology are likely to be significantly displaced,
              by a magnitude dependent on the unknown underlying lesion-deficit
              relationship itself. Past studies therefore cannot be
              retrospectively corrected, except by new knowledge that would
              render them redundant. Positively, we show that novel machine
              learning techniques employing high-dimensional inference can
              nonetheless accurately converge on the true locus. We conclude
              that current inferences about human brain function and deficits
              based on lesion mapping must be re-evaluated with methodology
              that adequately captures the high-dimensional structure of lesion
              data.",

              application of network-theory-based analysis to extend the
              utility of functional MRI has recently received increased
              attention. Such analyses require first and foremost a reasonable
              definition of a set of nodes as input to the network analysis. To
              date many applications have used existing atlases based on
              cytoarchitecture, task-based fMRI activations, or anatomic
              delineations. A potential pitfall in using such atlases is that
              the mean timecourse of a node may not represent any of the
              constituent timecourses if different functional areas are
              included within a single node. The proposed approach involves a
              groupwise optimization that ensures functional homogeneity within
              each subunit and that these definitions are consistent at the
              group level. Parcellation reproducibility of each subunit is
              computed across multiple groups of healthy volunteers and is
              demonstrated to be high. Issues related to the selection of
              appropriate number of nodes in the brain are considered. Within
              typical parameters of fMRI resolution, parcellation results are

              images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a
              dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
              in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
              encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
              automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the
              intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we
              used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new
              method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
              mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
              compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
              accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,
              and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and

              integrity of the motor system, whereas the left-to-right motor

              develop new therapies and prediction models for the promotion of
              stroke rehabilitation and recovery. However, there is no
              consensus among the neurorehabilitation community about which
              biomarker(s) have the highest predictive value for motor
              recovery. Objective To review the evidence and determine which
              neurological biomarker(s) meet the high evidence quality criteria
              for use in predicting motor recovery. Methods We searched
              databases for prognostic neuroimaging/neurophysiological studies.
              Methodological quality of each study was assessed using a
              previously employed comprehensive 15-item rating system.
              Furthermore, we used the GRADE approach and ranked the overall
              evidence quality for each category of neurologic biomarker.
              Results Seventy-one articles met our inclusion criteria; 5
              categories of neurologic biomarkers were identified: diffusion
              tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), conventional
              structural MRI (sMRI), and a combination of these biomarkers.
              Most studies were conducted with individuals after ischemic
              stroke in the acute and/or subacute stage (~70\%). Less than
              one-third of the studies (21/71) were assessed with satisfactory
              methodological quality (80\% or more of total quality score).
              Conventional structural MRI and the combination biomarker
              categories ranked ``high'' in overall evidence quality.
              Conclusions There were 3 prevalent methodological limitations:
              (a) lack of cross-validation, (b) lack of minimal clinically
              important difference (MCID) for motor outcomes, and (c) small
              sample size. More high-quality studies are needed to establish
              which neurological biomarkers are the best predictors of motor
              recovery after stroke. Finally, the quarter-century old

              corticospinal tract (CST) also receives fibers from dorsal and
              ventral premotor cortices and supplementary motor area, all of
              which might potentially contribute to motor function after
              stroke. We sought to quantify the microstructural integrity of
              CST originating from the hand representations in these 4 motor
              cortices separately and examined how these values related to hand
              motor impairment. METHODS: Probabilistic tractography from
              functional MRI-defined cortical sites demonstrated continuous CST
              originating from hand representations within each motor area in a
              group of healthy subjects. Microstructural integrity for each
              tract was calculated using fractional anisotropy at the level of
              the posterior limb of the internal capsule in a group of patients
              with chronic stroke. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was reduced
              in all 4 CSTs in the affected hemisphere. Grip strength
              correlated with the integrity of the CSTs originating from
              primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices, whereas, in a
              multiple regression model, the latter improved the ability of
              primary motor cortex CST to explain variability in grip strength.
              CONCLUSION: Handgrip critically depends on the CST originating in
              primary motor cortex but microstructural integrity of CST
              originating from premotor cortices appears to play a role in
              supporting motor function after stroke.",

              imaging measure of corticospinal tract (CST) injury in the acute
              phase can predict motor outcome at 3 months in comparison to
              clinical assessment of initial motor impairment. METHODS: A
              two-site prospective cohort study followed up a group of
              first-ever ischemic stroke patients using the Upper-Extremity
              Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) Scale to measure motor impairment in the acute
              phase and at 3 months. A weighted CST lesion load (wCST-LL) was
              calculated by overlaying the patient's lesion map on magnetic
              resonance imaging with a probabilistic CST constructed from
              healthy control subjects. Regression models were fit to assess
              the predictive value of wCST-LL and compared with initial motor
              impairment. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (37 from cohort 1 and
              39 from cohort 2) completed the study. wCST-LL as well as
              assessment of motor impairment (UE-FM) in the acute phase
              correlated with motor impairment (UE-FM) at 3 months in both
              cohort 1 (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.67; p = 0.43) and cohort 2
              (R(2) = 0.69 vs. R(2) = 0.62; p = 0.25). In the severely impaired
              subgroup (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 10 at baseline), wCST-LL
              correlated with outcomes significantly better than clinical
              assessment (R(2) = 0.47 vs. R(2) = 0.11; p = 0.03). In the
              nonseverely impaired subgroup, stroke patients recovered
              approximately 70\% of their maximal recovery potential. All
              stroke patients in both cohorts had poor motor outcomes at 3
              months (defined as UE-FM $\leq$ 25) when wCST-LL was $\geq$ 7.0
              cc (positive predictive value was 100\%). INTERPRETATION:
              wCST-LL, an imaging biomarker determined in the acute phase, can
              predict poststroke motor outcomes at 3 months, especially in
              patients with severe impairment at baseline.",

              that associates alterations in WM integrity with expected changes
              in neural connectivity between gray matter regions. The NeMo Tool
              uses a large reference set of healthy tractograms to assess
              implied network changes arising from a particular pattern of WM
              alteration on a region- and network-wise level. In this way, WM
              integrity changes can be extrapolated to the cortices and deep

              alterations. Unlike current techniques that assess network
              dysfunction, the NeMo tool does not require tractography in

              increases the risk of overfitting, calling for the use of
              dimensionality reduction methods to build robust predictive
              models. In this work, we assess the ability of four well-known
              dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant features
              from resting state functional connectivity matrices of stroke
              patients, which are then used to build a predictive model of the
              associated deficits based on cross-validated regularized
              regression. In particular, we investigated the prediction ability
              over different neuropsychological scores referring to language,
              verbal memory, and spatial memory domains. Principal Component
              Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) were the

              outcomes, as the ability to do so would inform treatment and
              rehabilitation strategies. However, it remains difficult to make
              accurate predictions about chronic post-stroke outcomes due, in
              large part, to high inter-individual variability in recovery and
              a reliance on clinical heuristics rather than empirical methods.
              The neuroanatomical location of a stroke is a key variable
              associated with long-term outcomes, and because lesion location
              can be derived from routinely collected clinical neuroimaging
              data there is an opportunity to use this information to make
              empirically based predictions about post-stroke deficits. For
              example, lesion location can be compared to statistically
              weighted multivariate lesion-behavior maps (LBMs) of
              neuroanatomical regions that, when damaged, are associated with
              specific deficits based on aggregated outcome data from large
              cohorts. Here, our goal was to evaluate whether we can leverage
              LBMs based on data from two large cohorts of individuals with
              focal brain lesions to make predictions of 12-month cognitive and
              motor outcomes in an independent sample of stroke patients.
              Further, we evaluated whether we could augment these predictions
              by estimating the structural and functional networks disrupted in
              association with each LBM through the use of structural and
              functional lesion network mapping (sLNM \& fLNM, respectively),
              which use normative structural and functional connectivity data
              from neurologically healthy individuals to elucidate
              lesion-associated networks. We derived these brain network maps
              using the anatomical regions with the strongest association with
              impairment for each cognitive and motor outcome based on LBM
              results. These peak regional findings became the 'seeds' to
              generate networks, an approach that offers potentially greater
              precision compared to previously used single-lesion approaches.
              Next, in an independent sample, we quantified the overlap of each
              lesion location with the LBM, sLNM, and fLNM and evaluated how
              much variance each could explain in 12-month behavioral outcomes
              using a latent growth curve statistical model. We found that each
              lesion-deficit mapping modality was able to predict a
              statistically significant amount of variance in cognitive and
              motor outcomes. Both fLNM and sLNM were able to predict variance
              in 12-month outcomes beyond LBM. fLNM performed best for the
              prediction of language deficits, and sLNM performed best for the
              prediction of motor deficits. Altogether, these results support
              the notion that lesion location and lesion network mapping can be
              combined to improve the prediction of post-stroke deficits at
              12-months.",

              brain T2-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopic (MRS) measurements of
              the neuronal marker compound N-acetyl aspartate in the posterior
              limb of the internal capsule, and motor impairment and disability
              measures. A corticospinal mask based on neuroanatomic landmarks
              was generated from a subset of the MRI data. The maximum
              proportion of the cross-sectional area of this mask occupied by
              stroke was determined for each patient after all brain images
              were transformed into a common stereotaxic brain space. RESULTS:
              There was a significant linear relationship between the maximum
              proportional cross-sectional area of the corticospinal mask
              occupied by stroke and motor deficit (r(2)=0.82, P<0.001),
              whereas the relationship between the total stroke volume and
              motor deficit was better described by a cubic curve (r(2)=0.76,
              P<0.001). Inspection of the data plots showed that the total
              stroke volume discriminated poorly between smaller strokes with
              regard to the extent of associated motor deficit, whereas the
              maximum proportion of the mask cross-sectional area occupied by
              stroke appeared to be a more discriminatory marker of motor
              deficit and also N-acetyl aspartate reduction. CONCLUSIONS:
              Segmentation of functional motor pathways on MRI allows
              estimation of the extent of damage specifically to that pathway
              by the stroke lesion. The extent of stroke intersection with the
              motor pathways was more linearly related to the magnitude of
              motor deficit than total lesion volume and appeared to be a
              better discriminator between small strokes with regard to motor
              deficit. This emphasizes the importance of the anatomic
              relationship of the infarct to local structures in determining
              functional impairment. Prospective studies are necessary to
              assess whether this approach would allow improved early
              estimation of prognosis after stroke.",

  abstract = "Hemiparesis is a common consequence of stroke to the primary
              motor system. Previous studies suggested that damage to
              additional brain areas might play a causal role in the occurrence
              and severity of hemiparesis and its recovery. Knowledge of these
              regions might be applied in the creation of imaging biomarkers
              for motor outcome prediction if lesion information from such
              areas carries predictive value. We assessed acute and chronic
              paresis of the upper limb in 102 patients with unilateral stroke.
              In a first experiment, the neural correlates of acute and chronic
              upper limb paresis were mapped by lesion behaviour mapping.
              Following the same approach, a lesion biomarker of corticospinal
              tract (CST) damage was mapped. This analysis served as an
              artificial control condition as the biomarker, by definition, is
              only causally related to damage of the CST. Mapping acute or
              chronic upper limb paresis implicated areas outside of the
              primary motor system. Likewise, mapping the CST lesion biomarker
              implicated several areas outside of the CST with high
              correspondence to areas associated with upper limb paresis.
              Damage to areas outside of the primary motor system thus might,
              to some degree, not play a causal role in hemiparesis. In a
              second experiment, we showed that lesion information from these
              areas outside of the primary motor system can be used to predict
              motor outcome. This was even the case for the CST lesion
              biomarker. Although the only causal source underlying the CST
              lesion biomarker was damage to the CST, lesion information that
              mainly included non-CST regions was able to predict the biomarker
              (non-significantly) better than information taken from only the
              CST itself. These findings suggest that simple theory-based
              biomarkers or qualitative rules to infer post-stroke outcome from
              imaging data might perform sub-optimally, as they do not consider
              the complexity of lesion data. Instead, high-dimensional models
              with data-driven feature selection strategies might be required.

              individualized predictions and to account for the interaction
              among units of information in the brain. Application of machine
              learning in structural imaging to investigate diseases that
              involve brain injury presents an additional challenge, especially
              in conditions like stroke, due to the high variability across
              patients regarding characteristics of the lesions. Extracting
              data from anatomical images in a way that translates brain damage
              information into features to be used as input to learning
              algorithms is still an open question. One of the most common
              approaches to capture regional information from brain injury is
              to obtain the lesion load per region (i.e. the proportion of
              voxels in anatomical structures that are considered to be
              damaged). However, no systematic evaluation has yet been
              performed to compare this approach with using patterns of voxels
              (i.e. considering each voxel as a single feature). In this paper
              we compared both approaches applying Gaussian Process Regression
              to decode motor scores in 50 chronic stroke patients based solely
              on data derived from structural MRI. For both approaches we
              compared different ways to delimit anatomical areas: regions of
              interest from an anatomical atlas, the corticospinal tract, a
              mask obtained from fMRI analysis with a motor task in healthy
              controls and regions selected using lesion-symptom mapping. Our
              analysis showed that extracting features through patterns of
              voxels that represent lesion probability produced better results
              than quantifying the lesion load per region. In particular, from
              the different ways to delimit anatomical areas compared, the best
              performance was obtained with a combination of a range of
              cortical and subcortical motor areas as well as the corticospinal
              tract. These results will inform the appropriate methodology for

              efforts to translationally apply lesion-behaviour modelling to
              predict post-stroke outcomes are on the rise. The
              high-dimensional complexity of lesion data, however, evokes
              challenges in both lesion behaviour mapping and post stroke
              outcome prediction. This paper aims to deepen the understanding
              of this complexity by reframing it from the perspective of causal
              and non-causal dependencies in the data, and by discussing what
              this complexity implies for different data modelling approaches.
              By means of theoretical discussion and empirical examination,
              several common strategies and views are challenged, and future
              research perspectives are outlined. A main conclusion is that
              lesion-behaviour inference is subject to a lesion-anatomical bias
              that cannot be overcome by using multivariate models or any other
              algorithm that is blind to causality behind relations in the
              data. This affects the validity of lesion behaviour mapping and
              might even wrongfully identify paradoxical effects of
              lesion-induced functional facilitation - but, as this paper
              argues, only to a minor degree. Thus, multivariate lesion-brain
              inference appears to be a valuable tool to deepen our
              understanding of the human brain, but only because it takes into
              account the functional relation between brain areas. The
              perspective of causality and inter-variable dependence is further
              used to point out challenges in improving lesion behaviour
              models. Firstly, the dependencies in the data open up different
              possible strategies of data reduction, and considering those
              might improve post-stroke outcome prediction. Secondly, the role
              of non-topographical causal predictors of post stroke behaviour
              is discussed. The present article argues that, given these
              predictors, different strategies are required in the evaluation

              Proprioceptive impairment also affects stroke recovery and may be
              related to CST damage. Methods. Robotic assessment quantified
              upper-limb motor and proprioceptive performance at 2 weeks and 6
              months poststroke (n = 149). Three previously-established CST

              tests and corticospinal tract (CST) microstructure may not
              reliably indicate severe motor impairment. Here, we test whether
              imaging biomarkers beyond the CST relate to severe upper limb
              impairment post-stroke by evaluating white matter microstructure
              in the corpus callosum (CC). In an international, multisite

              CST asymmetry index can differentiate between individuals with

              biomarkers relate to upper limb impairment within individuals

              asymmetry index would differentiate between mild-moderate and
              severe impairment, but CC microstructure would relate to motor
              outcome for individuals with severe upper limb impairment.

              mixed-effect regression explored relationships between candidate
              biomarkers and motor impairment, controlling for observations
              nested within cohorts, as well as age, sex, time post-stroke and
              lesion volume. RESULTS: Data from 110 individuals (30
              mild-moderate, 80 with severe motor impairment) were included. In
              the full sample, greater CST asymmetry index (i.e., lower
              fractional anisotropy in the ipsilesional hemisphere, p<.001) and
              larger lesion volume (p=.139) were negatively related to
              impairment. In the severe subgroup, CST asymmetry index was not
              reliably associated with impairment across models. Instead,
              lesion volume and CC microstructure explained impairment in the
              severe group beyond CST asymmetry index (p's<.010). CONCLUSIONS:
              Within a large cohort of individuals with severe upper limb
              impairment, CC microstructure related to motor outcome
              post-stroke. Our findings demonstrate that CST microstructure
              does relate to upper limb outcome across the full range of motor
              impairment but was not reliably associated within the severe
              subgroup. Therefore, CC microstructure may provide a promising
              biomarker for severe upper limb outcome post-stroke, which may
              advance our ability to predict recovery in people with severe
              motor impairment after stroke.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The supply territories of main cerebral arteries are
              predominantly identified based on distribution of infarct lesions
              in patients with large arterial occlusion; whereas, there is no
              consensus atlas regarding the supply territories of smaller
              end-arteries. In this study, we applied a data-driven approach to
              construct a stroke atlas of the brain using hierarchical density
              clustering in large number of infarct lesions, assuming that
              voxels/regions supplied by a common end-artery tend to infarct
              together. METHODS: A total of 793 infarct lesions on MRI scans of
              458 patients were segmented and coregistered to MNI-152 standard
              brain space. Applying a voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical
              density clustering algorithm, we identified those voxels that
              were most likely to be part of same infarct lesions in our
              dataset. A step-wise clustering scheme was applied, where the
              clustering threshold was gradually decreased to form the first 20
              mother (>50 cm3) or main (1-50 cm3) clusters in addition to any
              possible number of tiny clusters (<1 cm3); and then, any
              resultant mother clusters were iteratively subdivided using the
              same scheme. Also, in a randomly selected 2/3 subset of our
              cohort, a bootstrapping cluster analysis with 100 permutations
              was performed to assess the statistical robustness of proposed
              clusters. RESULTS: Approximately 91\% of the MNI-152 brain mask
              was covered by 793 infarct lesions across patients. The covered
              area of brain was parcellated into 4 mother, 16 main, and 123
              tiny clusters at the first hierarchy level. Upon iterative
              clustering subdivision of mother clusters, the brain tissue was
              eventually parcellated into 1 mother cluster (62.6 cm3), 181 main
              clusters (total volume 1107.3 cm3), and 917 tiny clusters (total
              volume of 264.8 cm3). In bootstrap analysis, only 0.12\% of
              voxels, were labelled as ``unstable'' - with a greater
              reachability distance in cluster scheme compared to their
              corresponding mean bootstrapped reachability distance. On visual
              assessment, the mother/main clusters were formed along supply
              territories of main cerebral arteries at initial hierarchical
              levels, and then tiny clusters emerged in deep white matter and
              gray matter nuclei prone to small vessel ischemic infarcts.
              CONCLUSIONS: Applying voxel-wise data-driven hierarchical density
              clustering on a large number of infarct lesions, we have
              parcellated the brain tissue into clusters of voxels that tend to
              be part of same infarct lesion, and presumably representing
              end-arterial supply territories. This hierarchical stroke atlas
              of the brain is shared publicly, and can potentially be applied
              for future infarct location-outcome analysis.",

              localising function in the human brain. As the highest court of
              appeal where competing theories of cerebral function conflict, it
              ought to be held to the most stringent inferential standards.
              Though at first sight elegantly transferable, the mass-univariate
              statistical framework popularized by functional imaging is
              demonstrably ill-suited to the task, both theoretically and
              empirically. The critical difficulty lies with the handling of
              the data's intrinsically high dimensionality. Conceptual opacity
              and computational complexity lead lesion-deficit mappers to
              neglect two distinct sets of anatomical interactions: those
              between areas unified by function, and those between areas
              unified by the natural pattern of pathological damage. Though
              both are soluble through high-dimensional multivariate analysis,
              the consequences of ignoring them are radically different. The
              former will bleach and coarsen a picture of the functional
              anatomy that is nonetheless broadly faithful to reality; the
              latter may alter it beyond all recognition. That the field
              continues to cling to mass-univariate methods suggests the latter
              problem is misidentified with the former, and that their
              distinction is in need of elaboration. We further argue that the
              vicious effects of lesion-driven interactions are not limited to
              anatomical localisation but will inevitably degrade purely
              predictive models of function such as those conceived for
              clinical prognostic use. Finally, we suggest there is a great
              deal to be learnt about lesion-mapping by simulation-based

              not widely applicable, as it requires imaging-compatible patients

              indirect estimation of structural disconnection offers an elegant
              and economical alternative. For this approach, a patient's
              structural lesion information and normative connectome data are

              Maps (AnaCOM): method and validation. NeuroImage 37: 1237-1249.)
              have recently described a novel approach for lesion-behavior
              mapping (LBM), referred to as Anatomo-Clinical Overlapping Maps
              (AnaCOM). Conventional voxelwise LBM tools apply statistics to
              contrast behavioral performance of patients with lesions that
              encompass given voxels to control patients where these voxels are
              spared. In contrast, AnaCOM contrasts performance of patients
              with injury involving given voxels to the performance of
              neurologically healthy participants. The authors correctly note
              that their procedure can offer substantially more statistical
              power than conventional LBM methods. We compared AnaCOM to
              conventional LBM techniques by examining hemiparesis (a common
              consequence of stroke) as the behavior of interest. We found that
              AnaCOM detected many regions of the middle cerebral artery
              territory not associated with the motor system. We suggest that
              conventional LBM techniques detect regions that are damaged in
              patients with a deficit while spared in those without a deficit,
              while AnaCOM detects regions that are associated with a deficit.
              Therefore, this new measure may offer poor specificity.
              Furthermore, on theoretical grounds we suggest that
              permutation-based thresholding will be a more sensitive method
              for controlling familywise error than the method of counting
              lesion-overlap clusters used by AnaCOM. Finally, we note that the
              within group variability tends to be smaller for neurologically
              healthy controls than in neurological patients, due to ceiling
              effects. Therefore, we suggest that nonparametric measures or the
              Welch's t-test are more appropriate than the conventional pooled
              variance t-test used by AnaCOM.",

  abstract = "Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for
              understanding the causality of brain-behavior relationships. The
              analyses are typically performed by applying statistical methods
              on individual brain voxels (VLSM), a method called the
              mass-univariate approach. Several authors have shown that VLSM
              suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and
              reliability of the findings, and have proposed the use of
              multivariate methods to overcome these limitations. In this
              study, we propose a multivariate optimization technique known as
              sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging (SCCAN)
              for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method and compare
              it with mass-univariate results, we used data from 131 patients
              with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle
              cerebral artery, and created synthetic behavioral scores based on
              the lesion load of 93 brain regions (putative functional units).
              LSM analyses were performed with univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and
              the accuracy of the two methods was compared in terms of both
              overlap and displacement from the simulated functional areas.
              Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results - higher dice
              overlap and smaller average displacement - compared to VLSM. This
              advantage persisted at different sample sizes (N = 20-131) and
              different multiple comparison corrections (false discovery rate,
              FDR; Bonferroni; permutation-based family wise error rate, FWER).
              These findings were replicated with a fully automated SCCAN
              routine that relied on cross-validated predictive accuracy to
              find the optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and
              three brain regions showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over
              VLSM; under no circumstance could VLSM exceed the accuracy
              obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional units composed
              of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than SCCAN.
              The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia
              quotient and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately
              identify known language-critical areas, while VLSM either
              produced diffuse maps (FDR correction) or few scattered voxels
              (FWER correction). Overall, this study shows that a multivariate
              method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a number of
              scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple
              areas, different sample sizes, different multi-area combinations,
              and different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR).
              These results support previous claims that multivariate methods
              are in general more accurate than mass-univariate approaches, and
              should be preferred over traditional VLSM approaches. All the
              methods described in this study are available in the newly
              developed LESYMAP package for R.",

              location on upper limb motor deficit in chronic patients with

              T1-weighted structural MRI in 33 chronic patients with stroke
              with either purely subcortical lesions (SC, n=19) or lesions
              extending to any of the cortical motor areas (CM, n=14). We
              estimated lesion likelihood maps over the whole brain and applied
              multivoxel pattern analysis to seek the contribution weight of
              lesion likelihood to upper limb motor deficit. Among 5 brain
              regions of interest, the brain region with the greatest
              contribution to motor deficit was determined for each subgroup.
              RESULTS: The corticospinal tract was most likely to be damaged in
              both subgroups. However, while damage in the corticospinal tract
              was the best indicator of motor deficit in the SC patients, motor
              deficit in the CM patients was best explained by damage in brain
              areas activated during handgrip. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of
              structural damage can add to models explaining motor outcome
              after stroke, but assessment of corticospinal tract damage alone
              is unlikely to be sufficient when considering patients with

              cortex, dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex,

              (preSMA), and primary somatosensory cortex using diffusion tensor

              conducted in 100 subjects using the highest resolution data
              currently available. Tractography results were refined using a
              novel algorithm to objectively determine slice level thresholds
              that best minimized overlap between tracts while preserving tract
              volume. Consistent with tracing studies in monkey and rodent, our
              observations show that cortical topography is generally preserved
              through the internal capsule, with the preSMA tract remaining
              most anterior and the primary somatosensory tract remaining most

  abstract = "Background The ability to predict outcome after stroke is
              clinically important for planning treatment and for
              stratification in restorative clinical trials. In relation to the
              upper limbs, the main predictor of outcome is initial severity,
              with patients who present with mild to moderate impairment
              regaining about 70\% of their initial impairment by 3 months
              post-stroke. However, in those with severe presentations, this
              proportional recovery applies in only about half, with the other
              half experiencing poor recovery. The reasons for this failure to
              recover are not established although the extent of corticospinal
              tract damage is suggested to be a contributory factor. In this
              study, we investigated 30 patients with chronic stroke who had
              presented with severe upper limb impairment and asked whether it
              was possible to differentiate those with a subsequent good or
              poor recovery of the upper limb based solely on a T1-weighted
              structural brain scan. Methods A support vector machine approach
              using voxel-wise lesion likelihood values was used to show that
              it was possible to classify patients as good or poor recoverers
              with variable accuracy depending on which brain regions were used
              to perform the classification. Results While considering damage
              within a corticospinal tract mask resulted in 73\% classification
              accuracy, using other (non-corticospinal tract) motor areas
              provided 87\% accuracy, and combining both resulted in 90\%
              accuracy. Conclusion This proof of concept approach highlights
              the relative importance of different anatomical structures in
              supporting post-stroke upper limb motor recovery and points
              towards methodologies that might be used to stratify patients in

              matter fibres. As a solution to this problem, we have previously
              published the ``spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of
              tractograms (SIFT)'' method, which determines a subset of the

              patients is used to build the method and test it with k-fold and
              leave-one-out procedures. With respect to manual tracings,
              predicted lesion maps showed a mean dice overlap of 0.696 $\pm$
              0.16, Hausdorff distance of 17.9 $\pm$ 9.8 mm, and average
              displacement of 2.54 $\pm$ 1.38 mm. The manual and predicted
              lesion volumes correlated at r = 0.961. An additional dataset of

              is clearly due to the structural brain damage that has been
              sustained, this relationship is attenuated from the acute to
              chronic phases. We investigated the possibility that motor
              impairment and response to constraint-induced movement therapy in
              patients with chronic stroke may relate more strongly to the
              structural integrity of brain structures remote from the lesion
              than to measures of overt tissue damage. METHODS: Voxel-based
              morphometry analysis was performed on MRI scans from 80 patients
              with chronic stroke to investigate whether variations in gray
              matter density were correlated with extent of residual motor
              impairment or with constraint-induced movement therapy-induced
              motor recovery. RESULTS: Decreased gray matter density in
              noninfarcted motor regions was significantly correlated with
              magnitude of residual motor deficit. In addition, reduced gray
              matter density in multiple remote brain regions predicted a
              lesser extent of motor improvement from constraint-induced
              movement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy in seemingly healthy parts

              disability or dependence in activities of daily living in stroke
              victims. The objective of this study was to investigate how these
              scales were used and interpreted in acute stroke trials. METHODS:
              We identified from MEDLINE the major efficacy trials with
              neuroprotective drugs, thrombolytic drugs, and anticoagulants in
              acute ischemic stroke published between January 1995 and December
              1998. We selected those trials that used the BI and/or MRS as
              outcome parameters. RESULTS: Fifteen trials fulfilling the
              inclusion criteria were identified. The BI was used in 13 and the
              MRS in 8. In 4 trials mean and median scores of the BI were used,
              and in 1 trial median scores of the MRS were compared. Primary
              end points included the BI in 7, the MRS in 6, and both the BI
              and MRS in 3. With regard to the BI, a variety of sum scores
              between 50 and 95 were used as cutoff scores to define favorable
              outcome. Favorable outcome on the MRS was defined as either 3, or

              faced when trying to predict an individual's functional outcome
              after stroke on the basis of lesion site. A primary goal is to
              find lesion-outcome associations that are consistently observed
              in large populations of stroke patients because consistent
              associations maximise confidence in future individualised
              predictions. To understand and control multiple sources of
              inter-patient variability, we need to systematically investigate
              each contributing factor and how each factor depends on other
              factors. This requires very large cohorts of patients, who differ
              from one another in typical and measurable ways, including lesion
              site, lesion size, functional outcome and time post stroke (weeks
              to decades). These multivariate investigations are complex,
              particularly when the contributions of different variables
              interact with one another. Machine learning algorithms can help
              to identify the most influential variables and indicate
              dependencies between different factors. Multivariate lesion
              analyses are needed to understand how the effect of damage to one
              brain region depends on damage or preservation in other brain
              regions. Such data-led investigations can reveal predictive
              relationships between lesion site and outcome. However, to
              understand and improve the predictions we need explanatory models
              of the neural networks and degenerate pathways that support
              functions of interest. This will entail integrating the results

              potentials) have become the most popular method for inferring
              brain function. However, examining brain disruption (e.g.,
              examining behavior after brain injury) can complement activation
              studies. Activation techniques identify regions involved with a
              task, whereas disruption techniques are able to discover which
              regions are crucial for a task. Voxel-based lesion mapping can be
              used to determine relationships between behavioral measures and
              the location of brain injury, revealing the function of brain
              regions. Lesion mapping can also correlate the effectiveness of
              neurosurgery with the location of brain resection, identifying
              optimal surgical targets. Traditionally, voxel-based lesion
              mapping has employed the chi-square test when the clinical
              measure is binomial and the Student's t test when measures are
              continuous. Here we suggest that the Liebermeister approach for
              binomial data is more sensitive than the chi-square test. We also
              suggest that a test described by Brunner and Munzel is more
              appropriate than the t test for nonbinomial data because clinical
              and neuropsychological data often violate the assumptions of the

              Because brain function is a result of coherent activations of a
              collection of functionally related voxels, lesion-symptom
              relations are generally contributed by multiple voxels
              simultaneously. Although voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping
              (VLSM) has made substantial contributions to the understanding of
              brain-behavior relationships, a better understanding of the
              brain-behavior relationship contributed by multiple brain regions
              needs a multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (MLSM). The purpose
              of this artilce was to develop an MLSM using a machine
              learning-based multivariate regression algorithm: support vector
              regression (SVR). In the proposed SVR-LSM, the symptom relation
              to the entire lesion map as opposed to each isolated voxel is
              modeled using a nonlinear function, so the intervoxel
              correlations are intrinsically considered, resulting in a

              relationships. To explore the relative merits of VLSM and SVR-LSM
              we used both approaches in the analysis of a synthetic dataset.
              SVR-LSM showed much higher sensitivity and specificity for

              More recently, multivariate lesion symptom mapping (MLSM) methods
              have been developed that consider the effects of all lesioned

              the applicability of our models in an independent sample of
              patients from controlled clinical trials. METHODS: The prognostic
              models were used to predict survival and functional recovery in
              5419 patients from the Virtual International Stroke Trials
              Archive (VISTA). Furthermore, we tried to improve the accuracy by
              adapting intercepts and estimating new model parameters. RESULTS:
              The original models were able to correctly classify 70.4\%
              (survival) and 72.9\% (functional recovery) of patients. Because
              the prediction was slightly pessimistic for patients in the
              controlled trials, adapting the intercept improved the accuracy
              to 74.8\% (survival) and 74.0\% (functional recovery). Novel

              surface, and local soma densities were displayed on this plane as
              contour and 3-D maps. At least nine discrete, somatotopically
              organized corticospinal projections were identified. Three
              separate corticospinal projections originated in frontal cortex.
              The first projected mostly from area 4 (approximately 35\% of the
              total contralateral neuron population), but also from the
              adjacent dorsolateral area 6a alpha (approximately 6\% of total).
              The second large corticospinal projection (approximately 15\% of
              total) originated in the supplementary motor area and a third
              small projection (approximately 2.6\% of total) projected from

              boundary between the primary motor and somatosensory cortex there
              was a sharp change in the pattern of projections. Only
              approximately 2.2\% of the contralateral corticospinal projection
              originated in area 3a, rising to approximately 9\% in areas 3b/1,
              and approximately 13\% in areas 2/5. The projections from SII and
              insula totaled 3.4\%. Ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal
              projection patterns were similar, but the ipsilateral projection
              was only approximately 8.1\% of that from the contralateral

              inputs, and each of which has continuous access to all spinal

              infarct. For each subject, the degree to which stroke injured
              each of 4 descending white matter tracts (from the primary motor
              cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsal premotor cortex, and
              ventral premotor cortex, respectively) was determined.
              Correlations between tract-specific injury and behavioral gains
              from therapy were then examined. RESULTS: Numerous examples were
              found whereby tract-specific injury predicted treatment gains.
              The strongest correlations pertained to stroke injury to tracts
              descending from the primary motor cortex and dorsal premotor
              cortex. Infarct volume and baseline behavior were weak predictors
              of treatment gains. CONCLUSIONS: Extent of injury to specific
              motor tracts predicts behavioral gains from treatment in subjects
              with chronic stroke. This supports a role for these tracts in
              mediating treatment effects and reinforces the importance of
              lesion location in stroke. Tract-specific injury was stronger
              than infarct volume or baseline clinical status at predicting
              gains, identifies subjects with sufficient biological substrate
              to improve from therapy, and so might be useful as an entry
              criterion in repair-based trials.",

              A critical review",
  author   = "Kapur, N",
  abstract = "The aim in this review article is to document research findings
              that have shown paradoxical effects of nervous system changes,
              whereby direct or indirect neural damage may result in
              facilitation of behavioural functions. Such findings have often
              been ignored or undervalued in the brain-behaviour research
              literature. A further aim is to consider possible mechanisms and
              theoretical insights related to this facilitation. Analyses of
              relevant studies show that two major types of paradoxical
              functional facilitation (PFF) effects may be distinguished. (i)
              Situations where damage to intact brain tissue brings to normal
              or near normal a previously subnormal or abnormal level of
              functioning. I refer to improved levels of functioning in such
              contexts as restorative PFF effects. One of the best documented
              examples of such PFF effects is the 'Sprague effect', whereby
              collicular lesions may bring about an improvement in visual
              functioning following an initial occipital lesion. (ii)
              Situations where a subject with nervous system pathology or
              sensory loss performs better than normal control subjects on a
              particular task. I refer to improved levels of performance in
              these contexts as enhancing PFF effects. Restorative and
              enhancing PFF effects have been found in a range of domains,
              including memory, sensory and perceptual functions, and language
              functioning. A potential contribution of PFF effects is that they
              highlight two important neural mechanisms, i.e. inhibition and
              compensatory plasticity. Two broad classes of theoretical
              insights related to PFF effects are therefore discussed: (i)
              inhibitory mechanisms, which form part of an interactive view of
              brain function where competitive opponent-processing is a
              significant feature; (ii) 'compensatory augmentation', which
              occurs as a specific manifestation of CNS plasticity. Both of
              these mechanisms are considered in relation to paradoxical
              increases in CBF and anatomical annexation effects that are seen
              in neurological patients and in subjects with sensory loss.
              Paradoxical functional facilitation paradigms represent a
              powerful methodological tool for confirming or refuting
              hypotheses in brain-behaviour research. The counter-intuitive
              nature of PFF findings provides a particularly persuasive set of
              evidence in support of neural, conceptual or computational models
              of brain function that specifically predict paradoxical
              facilitation of cognitive functioning.",
