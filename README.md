# M1 corticospinal tract lesion load
![M1_pic](figures/M1.png)
Calculate the lesion load on the corticospinal tract originating from ipsilesional M1. 
Template: [Sensorimotor Area Tract Template (SMATT)](http://lrnlab.org/)
Calculated as the number of lesioned voxels that intersect with the ipsilesional M1-CST.

# Sensorimotor Area Tract Template (SMATT) lesion load
![SMATT_pic](figures/all_SMATT_stacked.png)
Calcualte the lesion load on all ipsilesional corticospinal tracts originating from M1 (primary motor cortex), S1 (sensorimotor cortex), SMA (supplementary motor area), pre-SMA (pre-supplementary motor area), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd).
Calculated as the proportion of lesioned voxels that intersect with each ipsilesional tract.

- MATLAB: SMATT_lesion_load.m (requires FSL)
- python: SMATT_lesion_load.ipynb (uses nibabel)

# Lesion Behaviour Map lesion load
![LBM_pic](figures/lbm.png)
This map was generated by [Bowren et al. 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025994/), who used sparse canonical correlation 
analysis to produce maps of voxels in which damage was associated with Fugl-Meyer scores. Lesion load to this lesion-behaviour map (LBM-LL) was calculated as the sum of voxels 
in the LBM that intersect with the lesion. If you use this map, please cite the appropriate source:

# Change in Connectivity (ChaCo) scores
![nemo_pic](figures/chaco-git.png)
The Network Modification Tool [NeMo 2.1](https://kuceyeski-wcm-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/upload.html) can be used to estimate regional or pairwise change in connectivity (ChaCo) scores, given a binary lesion mask.
